```

# Exercice 4 Hashing

1. Create a folder named hash_checksum. Go into this folder
```
mkdir hash_checksum
cd hash_checksum/
```
2. Inside this folder, create two files named .sensible_addresses and .sensible_passwords
```
touch .sensible_addresses 
touch .sensible_passwords
```
3. Display the list of files of the folder
```
ls -a
```
4. Still inside the folder hash_checksum, create a script named gentle_script.sh. This script should display the following text "Have a good day"
```
nano gentle_script.sh

echo "Have a good day"
```
5. Run the script
```
source gentle_script.sh
```
6. Compute the sha256sum of gentle_script. Store it into a file named
log_sha
```
sha256sum gentle_script.sh > log_sha
```
7. Now corrupt the file by adding a line of code that deletes any file starting with : ".sensible"
```
echo "rm -rf .sensible*" >> gentle_script.sh
```
8. Compute again the sha256sum of gentle_script. Store it into the log_sha
file
```
sha256sum gentle_script.sh >> log_sha
```
9. Run the script
```
source gentle_script
```
10. Display again the list of files of the folder
```
ls -a
```
11. Display the log_sha content : are the hashes any different ?
```
cat log_sha
```
