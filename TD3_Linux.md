# Exercice 1 Grep and awk on tabular data

1. Display the list of files and folders at the root using ls -l
```
```
2. In a pipeline (using |), append a grep instruction to only display informations
of bin
```
```
3. Append an awk instruction to only display the size of bin
```
```
4. Now rather extract the month, day and year of creation of the folder bin
```
```
5. Now rearrange the instruction to get the following output format : 2020-
Oct-26 (from original data : Oct 26 2020)
```
```

# Exercice 2 Grep with Regex, and sed on unstructured data

1. Run the following command :
curl https ://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cyberattacks > cyberattacks.txt

2. Use grep to extract all the lines that contain the keyword "meta"

3. Now only extract "meta" and the first following word. You might use
grep options to enable the use of regex (Regular Expressions) 1

4. Only extract the follwing word (but not the keyword "meta")

5. Let’s now try more interesting (yet complex) patterns. You might use vim
to open the file and look for useful patterns. Let’s extract the introduction
— We could ask grep to catch the paragraph corresponding to a sentence
that is only present in the introduction. Try to run the following
command cat cyberattacks.txt | grep -P ’A cyberattack is’

— This does not work since the source code is here different from what
is visible on the web page. Now try the following : cat cyberattacks.txt |
grep -P ’A <a href="/wiki/Cyberattack" title="Cyberattack">cyberattack</a>
is any type’

— It is now working, but what if the text evolves over time ? Try the
following instead : cat cyberattacks.txt | grep -A1 ’mw-content-text’ |
grep -v ’mw-content-text’. This is based on the text above that seems
to be more stable.

6. Your turn
— Extract the tab title

— Make a list of cyber attacks based on section titles
